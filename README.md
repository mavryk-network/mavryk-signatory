## What is Signatory?

Signatory is a remote signing daemon that allows people running Mavryk bakers to securely sign endorsement and baking operations with a variety of different key management systems.

The goal of the Signatory service is to make key management as secure as possible in a Cloud and on-premise HSM context.

## Why Use Signatory?

Security and convenience are typically at odds with each other. Signatory makes it easier for Mavryk node operators to manage their keys securely by offering several well-tested & supported signing options for cloud-based or hardware-based HSMs.

## Quick Start

[See docs](/docs/README.md)

## Features

### Remote Signing

Signatory receives signing requests from either a baker or an endorser, signs the data using one of its backends, and returns a signature.

### Observability

Signatory is also focused on observability, meaning that it exposes metrics about its operations. Metrics allow operators to see historical trends, signing volumes, errors and latencies, enabling rich reporting and alerting capabilities.

### Private-Key Import

Private-key import is an important security consideration when choosing a Cloud HSM offering. Some HSMs allow you to generate the secret key internally so that no one can extract the private key from the HSM. Others allow for private-key import with different levels of security. The trade-offs in this context are essential to understand.

---

## How it Works

* Mavryk sends a signing request to Signatory
* Signatory checks that the operation is either `block` or `endorsement`
* Signatory sends the operation to the configured backend for singing
* Upon receiving the signing operation from the backend, Signatory validates the signature with a Mavryk node (optional)
* Signatory returns the operation signature to the Mavryk node

## Supported Signing Backends

Signatory currently supports [Azure Key Vault][0]. Other backend signing services are either in the planning phase or are currently in development.

We are adding support for additional backend Key Management Systems (KMS) for the secure handling of private keys. Most cloud-based KMS systems offer an HSM-backed mode, which we strongly recommend.

Our goal in supporting multiple Cloud KMS/HSM services is to help in preventing centralization on the _network_ or _infrastructure_ level. A goal of Mavryk is to have a highly decentralized network of bakers. That goal is not fully realized if, of those bakers, a large majority operate on a single infrastructure provider.

In the first year of the Mavryk network operation, there was anecdotal evidence that a large percentage of bakers run on AWS. AWS is a superb provider, but having a concentration of nodes on one cloud vendor centralizes the underlying infrastructure of the network, which is not desirable. By supporting multiple Cloud KMS/HSM systems, we hope to prevent the network from centralization on a particular Cloud offering.

### Backend KMS/HSM Support Status

|                  | Status      |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| YubiHSM2         | Implemented |
| Azure KMS        | In Testing  |
| Google Cloud KMS | In Testing  |
| AWS KMS          | Planned     |

### Mavryk Address Types

In Mavryk, you can infer the signing algorithm from the first three characters of an address. For example, an address beginning with `mv3` uses the P-256 algorithm. HSMs and Cloud-based HSMs have support for a subset of the three algorithms supported by Mavryk.

* `mv1` - [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)
* `mv2` - [Secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) __aka: P256K__
* `mv3` - P-256

## Signing Algorithm Support From Various Backends

|                  | mv1 | mv2 | mv3 |
| ---------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Cloud KMS | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   |
| AWS KMS          | ❌   | ✅   | ✅   |
| Azure KMS        | ❌   | ✅   | ✅   |
| YubiHSM2         | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |

## Alternative Remote Signers

At least three other remote signers are available to use with Mavryk. Mavryk also provides native support for baking with a Ledger Nano. We encourage bakers to, at a minimum, review these projects. We are eager to collaborate and be peers with these great projects.
